# Updated Rubric for the Take-Home Exam

Dear all,

My apologies, it has come to my attention that there was a mistake in the posted rubric (it was missing one level and it didnt add up to 30%). I have now eddited it and you can find it below. Not much has changed, so your goals should be the same, just making sure it is all correct and the criteria are clear and open.
